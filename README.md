<h3>Description:</h3>
The game of Sudoku is still a popular game. For those of you who donâ€™t know how to solve a Sudoku problem, here is a brief explanation of the rules:
1) The game board consists of a 9x9 grid, further broken down into a 3x3 set of smaller 3x3
grids with each individual cell of the grid to eventually contain a digit between 1 and 9.
2) The final goal is to fill the board with digits so that all of the following are true:
3) Each row of 9 cells contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.
4) Each column of 9 cells contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.
5) Each of the smaller 3x3 grids contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.

<h3>The Program:</h3>
1) Prompts the user to enter a file name.
2) Opens that file and reads in the Sudoku puzzle contained within (the files consist of 9 rows of 9 single digit numbers each, with zeroes representing the initially empty cells). The program displays the initial problem as a 9x9 grid.
3) The program then solves the puzzle by filling in the empty cells of the grid and displays the final solution.
