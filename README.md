<h3>Description:</h3>
The game of Sudoku is still relatively popular in this country. For those of you who don’t know how to solve a Sudoku problem, here is a brief explanation of the rules:
 The game board consists of a 9x9 grid, further broken down into a 3x3 set of smaller 3x3
grids (see the example below) with each individual cell of the grid to eventually contain a digit
between 1 and 9.
 The final goal is to fill the board with digits so that all of the following are true:
o Each row of 9 cells contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.
o Each column of 9 cells contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.
o Each of the smaller 3x3 grids contains the digits 1 through 9 in some order with no repeats or omissions.
